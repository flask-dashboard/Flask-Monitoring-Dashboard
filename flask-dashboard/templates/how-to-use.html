    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <p>A dashboard for automatic monitoring of python web services</p>
</header>

<h2>Do you need a password?</h2>
<p>If you run your app with in debug-mode: <b>app.run(debug=True)</b>, then you can directly view your
    dashboard without using a password. However, if you run your app in production-mode: <b>app.run(debug=False)</b>,
    then you're redirected to a login-page. You can change your password in the <a href="/{{ link }}/settings">settings</a>
    page.</p>

<h2>More information on the config-function</h2>
<p>As explained in <a href="/{{ link }}/how-to-use">how-to-use</a>, the only code required for
    configuring this project is the following:</p>
<pre><code>from flask import Flask
import dashboard

app = Flask(__name__)
dashboard.bind(app)
</code></pre>
<p>But, the code above isn't all you can do with this extension, there are a few more settings
    that you can achieve with this application. For configuring the settings, you need to have a config-file.
    An example of a config-file is shown below:</p>
<pre><code>[dashboard]
DATABASE=sqlite:///flask-dashboard.db
CUSTOM_LINK=dashboard
APP_VERSION=1.0
GROUP_BY=None</code></pre>

<p>The need and usage of all variables are explained below:</p>

<h3>The routing '/dashboard' already exists</h3>
<p>Suppose you have an enormous website that uses many routings. One of those routings is
    '/dashboard'. Thus you cannot configure this extension, since each routing must be unique. For this
    purpose, it is possible to config every page from the extension to a different link. This is done by setting
    the following variable in the config-file:</p>
<pre><code>CUSTOM_LINK=dashboard</code></pre>

<h3>A different database location</h3>
<p>Suppose that you're working on a project for which you have two stages: development-stage and
    production-stage. You want to separate the data collected from both stages. Then, you have to
use two database-files, one for each stage. For this purpose, you can add the following variable
to the config-file:</p>
<pre><code>DATABASE=sqlite:///flask-dashboard.db</code></pre>
<p>By default, the standard database name is 'flask_database.db' and can be found at your home-location.</p>

<h3>Tracking the performance of different versions</h3>
<p>The main functionality of this extension is to see whether different versions of your application
    perform better than others. Does the execution time of some functions have been improved or not? To specify
    which version application-version you have, you can add the following variable to the config-file:</p>
<pre><code>APP_VERSION=1.0</code></pre>

<p>By default, the version is 1.0.</p>
<p>If you're using git, then it easier to specify a git location. The version of your app is the
entire hash-function of your current git-commit. Now, you automatically retrieve a new version if you make a commit.
The value of the variable is relative to the location of your config-file.'/.git'</p>
    <pre><code>GIT=/.git/</code></pre>

<h3>Tracking the performance of different users</h3>
<p>The main functionality of this extension is to see whether different users of your application
    perform better than others. Which users get fast execution times, and which not? To specify the selection of
    different users, you have to specify a group_by-variable. Suppose you save your username in session['username'],
    then the function groups all execution times based on session['username']. In this case, the group_by-variable
    is 'username'.</p>
<pre><code>GROUP_BY='username'</code></pre>
<p>By default, the performance per user is not configured. If you don't use session-variables, then you can't use
    this feature. </p>
